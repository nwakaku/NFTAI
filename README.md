# Nifta - AI meets NFTs

## What is Nifta?
Nifta is project that utilizes the Theta blockchain to enable users to generate AI-powered images based on prompts using the DALL-E image model. These generated images can be minted as unique non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and listed on the Nifta platform for sale. By selling their NFTs, artists can earn TFUEL, the native cryptocurrency of the Theta blockchain. Additionally, users can explore and purchase NFTs created by other talented artists, expanding their digital art collection.
